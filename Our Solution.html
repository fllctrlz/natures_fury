<h1> Our Solution </h1>

<h2> Review of Existing Solutions </h2>
<p> Existing solutions include candle lanterns and an automatic shut off gas candle which extinguishes the fire when moved from its vertical position.  When using a gas candle, there is a risk of explosion if the components have deteriorated, the gas is poisonous and flammable.  As well, if there was a lack of matches and the gas candle shut off, it would not be ideal to use another match to relight the candle.  When a lit candle lantern falls and lands on its side, the candle wax will smother its own fire over time.  This leads to using another match which becomes a problem when they are scarce.  Also, a candle lantern is prone to overheating.  On the other hand, the Upright Light will remain lit even when knocked over. </p>

<h2> The Upright Light Overview</h2>
<p> The Upright Light is an untippable safety candle holder that reduces the risk of fires during winter storms and other natural disasters.  The inspiration for the Upright Light came from a product called the Gyrobowl which is a bowl that always stays upright to prevent children's cereal spilling on the floor.  The Upright Light consists of a cubic frame that supports a candle holder using two axles that allow the bottom-weighted holder to pivot on two axes.  The rotation allows the candle to always face upright, even when knocked over.  As the candle can right itself immediately, the risk of surrounding objects catching fire is mitigated.  Candles are invaluable for their light and heat output and our invention allows them to be used safely while the power is out, particularly during ice storms, when the supply of electricity is often interrupted.</p>

<h2> The Upright Light Detailed Description</h2>
<p>Candles are an invaluable source of heat and light during power outages in natural disasters.  However, candles pose a fire risk.  A candle can destroy a house by getting knocked over or when something flammable, such as furniture, bedding, or curtains, comes too close to it.  In the U.S., 42 home candle fires are reported each day, and that number rises during power outages.  The risk of candle fires appears larger when candles are used for heat.  During the 1998 ice storm, 11 people from the Province of Quebec died due to candles and other fire sources.   2 houses in the City of Toronto burned down due to candles during the December 2013 ice storm.</p>

Our invention allows candles to be used safely while the power is out, particularly during ice storms, when the supply of electricity is often interrupted.  </p>
<p>Our initial prototype was constructed of LEGO.  It works very well, so we started to think of how we would implement it:</p>
<ul class="listtraits"> 
<li class="listtraits"> It would be made of aluminum to be light, strong, and non-flammable</li>
<li class="listtraits"> The candle holder would have a receptacle to hold a normal replaceable tea-light (they are very inexpensive, as low as 4 cents each). The receptacle would be a rubber ring that fits snugly around a candle to secure it during impacts. This allows the user to replace the candle once it burns out. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our second prototype was created using a 3D printer and is made of plastic with some brass axles and bushings for the pivot points.  When tested, it performed as well as our initial prototype but had the advantage of being more compact.  </p>

<p>We are very excited with the performance of our prototypes and are now in discussions with a third party who has expressed an interest in potentially taking the product to market.</p>

<p> Our first attempt at 3D printing the prototype did not work out well because the melted plastic sagged, resulting in weakness and deformity. </p>

<p> Our second attempt worked because we used a stronger plastic and it was printed in two parts (and subsequently glued together) to avoid a horizontal section that can sag. </p>

<h2> Manufacturing Costs </h2>
<p> This is our financial projection for the Upright Light.  Some of our assumptions contained in the projection are: </p>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> $110,000 in tooling to manufacture the Upright Light </li>
<li class="listtraits"> $0.04 for a regular Ikea tealight </li>
<li class="listtraits"> $4 for the aluminum needed to maufacture the Upright Light </li>
<li class="listtraits"> there are 10 million households in Ontario of which only 18% have an emergency kit </li>
<li class="listtraits"> assuming 10% of those with a kit would want to replace their candles and a market share of 15%, this means a first year sales volume of 27,000 Upright Lights</li>
<li class="listtraits"> assuming a selling price for each light of $10.50, this represents a first year revenue of $283,500 </li>
<li class="listtraits"> in the first year, the profit (assuming a 25% income tax rate) is $73,393 </li> 
<li class="listtraits"> the value of our business today is $739,397 based on a 24% discount rate </li>  
<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/FinancialProjectionCapture.jpg" class="solution" height="75%">
<p> Our financial projection suggests that with reasonable assumptions regarding market share, selling price and cost per unit, production and sale of our Upright Light would be a viable business. </p>
