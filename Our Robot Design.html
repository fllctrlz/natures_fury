<h1> High-Level Strategy</h1>

<p>
For the last two FLL seasons the team has taken the approach of designing, building and programming two separate robots.  The robots each have different 
features, strengths and weaknesses.  While the team strives to create robots which are as repeatable as possible, it recognizes that 100% repeatability is 
unachievable with a single robot given varying robot game table conditions, mat sizes, mat colors and light conditions.  The two-robot approach provides the
 team with a diversified approach which reduces reliance on just one robot.  As most tournaments consist of 3 rounds (and perhaps a "for fun" sudden death 
playoff), the team alternates robots over the course of a tournament.  To adhere with the <a href="Rules.html" target="_blank ">robot game rules </a>, 


we make sure that only
 one micro controller is in the robot game competition area for any one match.  While the focus of this website is on one of the team's robots, we offer 
the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76uAo1S5CCo" target="_blank"> video</a> of the second robot (which this year uses the EV3 controller
 and electrical components).  </p>


<h1> Design</h1>


<h2> Process </h2>
<p> When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height, balance, drivetrain, sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype.  We also strive to design and build a base robot which is robust and which features a frame around the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square up against walls and mission models. After creating a working prototype, we design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be easy to install and remove, robust, and both passive and multipurpose whenever possible.  From testing the prototype base robot and the attachments, we make revisions to our work in order to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve maximum efficiency.  By the end of the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration. </p>

</ul>


<h2> Strategy </h2>

<p> Our team's robot and general strategy was to: </p>
<ul class="listtraits"> 
<li class="listtraits"> maximize points per second (i.e. minimize time in base and try to complete as many missions in as short of a time as possible)</li>
<li class="listtraits"> combine missions based on proximity and attachment used (see diagram below) </li>
<br/>
<br/>
<br>
<center>
<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/NewZones.jpg" width="60%">
</center>
<br/>
<li class="listtraits"> use an aiming jig to precisely aim the robot in base </li>
<li class="listtraits"> use reference points on the mat (lines, wall, and mission models) </li>
<li class="listtraits"> not use leave-behind attachments anymore due to the junk penalty </li>
<li class="listtraits"> follow the wall when possible to go straight </li>
</ul>
<p> Our mission strategies were to: </p>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> use the touch sensor bumper to know how far to push the detour sign and to optimally position the robot to complete the base isolation mission </li>
<li class="listtraits"> hit the right side of the plate on the base isolation mission because we found that that method was the most consistent in knocking over the east tan building </li>
<li class="listtraits"> deliver as much as possible to the red zone in one mission (as to avoid multiple trips) </li>
<li class="listtraits"> not attempt the obstacle mission because the mission takes a lot of time (both during the match and in the preparation) and does not score well </li>
<li class="listtraits"> hit the base of the tree to dislodge the branch on the tree mission</li>
<li class="listtraits"> choose which mission to run depending on available time.  Toward the end of the match, we either choose to: (a) head straight to the red zone with our cargo, or (b) deliver truck and ambulance, perform base isolation, reposition grey buildings, raise the detour sign and, finally, deliver cargo to the red zone </li>
</ul> 
<h2> Our Base Robot </h2>
<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/Little%20Robot.jpg" height="40%" align="center" class="robot">
<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/Little%20Robot%20Bottom.jpg" height="40%" align="center" class="robot">
<p> We designed the base robot to fit the physical constraints of <a href="../../wiki.ornl.gov/events/tennfll/ref/Referees/NaturesFury-Mat.jpg" target="_blank">
 the playing field </a> such as the low lying string from the airplane.  Therefore, we mounted the brain (the NXT controller) horizontally on top of the 2 drive motors and the third motor above the brain.  The brain is floating, which means that it is not connected by pegs to the robot, so we can easily change the battery.  Our base robot has 2 light sensors at the front so that we can use our PID line following and square up to lines.  Our robot also features two bumpers, one on the front of the robot and one at the back, operated by a single touch sensor.  This enables the robot to know when to stop moving when apporaching a mission model or wall.  Lastly, our robot has a direct drive system.  We do not use gears for our drive system because they tend to be inaccurate and cause gear lash (the free play between the meshed components in a gear train).  When we designed the robot, we wanted it to: </p>
<ul class="listtraits"> 
<li class="listtraits"> have guide wheels so it can follow the wall </li>
<li class="listtraits"> use rear sliders, instead of casters, which are steering neutral
<li class="listtraits"> have a kill switch to stop programs when needed</li>
<li class="listtraits"> have a frame around the perimeter of the robot so that it could square up to walls </li>
<li class="listtraits"> have many possible connection points for attachments </li>
<li class="listtraits"> be narrow to fit between the tsunami launcher and the house but still wide enough to accomplish consistent pivot turns </li>
<li class="listtraits"> have a small footprint to manoeuvre around in tight spaces </li>
<li class="listtraits"> have narrow, small, hard wheels to increase the accuracy of the robot's movements but sacrificing speed </li>
<li class="listtraits"> have accessible microcontroller display and buttons for ease of access by operator </li>
<li class="listtraits"> have fore/aft balance to ensure adequate traction for drive wheels </li>
<li class="listtraits"> have left/right symmetry for greater repeatability of movements </li>  
</ul>  
<p> At the beginning of the season, we started with a modular robot (a robot that can be attached to different chassis using gears) but we found that its footprint was large and its movements were not repeatable so we made the version 2.0 more compact, resulting in a smaller footprint and a direct drive system to prevent inaccuracies.

<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/Airplane%20Attachment%20Extended.jpg" class="robot" align="center" height="40%">  
<ul class="listtraits"> 
<li class="listtraits"> the airplane attachment triggers when the robot leaves base </li> 
<li class="listtraits"> the attachment remains in base even though the robot departs in a different direction towards the tree </li>  
<li class="listtraits"> a pivot point at the top of the attachment joins the two arms which, when extended, allow the attachment to reach the airplane tower while the other side still remains in base </li>  
<li class="listtraits"> there is a ramp at the end of one arm which allows the triggering cart to accelerate as it leaves the base.  The ramp has a guiding beam to ensure that the triggering cart leaves bases in a straight line </li> 
<li class="listtraits"> an elastic band pulls the first arm down to initiate the extension of the articulating arm </li>
<li class="listtraits"> six wheels (with tires) positioning at the joint serve to provide additional forward momentum to the triggering cart </li>
<li class="listtraits"> triggering cart features: (a) 2 guide wheels to ensure that the car follows the wall, and (b) an elevated arm positioned perfectly to hit the red triggering mechanism on the airplane tower </li> 
</ul> 


<h3> Pets Attachment </h3>

<p> Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAlY13mkcFk" target="_blank">here</a> to view a video of the "Clamp" in action. </p>  

<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> Black bridge plate hopper carries scoring items (loops, fuel, medicine, etc.) to the red zone.  The hopper has pivoting lids which protect the contents from the low airplane zip line at the north-east corner of the field.  The hopper is positioned at the perfect height to brush the tsunamis releasing them onto the mat </li>
<li class="listtraits"> U-shaped clamp which carries two grey building units from base to the north-east corner of the field and deposits them on top of the three grey building units.  The A-motor releases the clamp at the correct moment to create a 5-storey grey building </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Use of elastic bands for friction to ensure that two grey building units are not released prematurely</li>
<li class="listtraits"> Passive release of blue truck (resting on protruding Technic beams) into scoring zone by accelerating the robot and suddenly stopping causing the momentum to release it </li> 
</ul>
