<h1> The Problem </h1>
<h2> Problem Identification </h2>
<p> During a power outage causing snow or ice storm, people will rely on candles more often because they provide both light and heat.  However, as the use of candles increase, there will be a higher risk of candle fires occurring.  Also, candles are a very important item in the emergency preparedness kit promoted by Emergency Management Ontario (EMO).  So we thought that we needed to address this risk. </p>
<h2> Expert Meetings </h2>
<h3> Meeting notes - Anastasios Venetikidis, University of Toronto </h3>
<p> On October 11, 2013, Ctrl-Z met with a flood expert, Anastasios Venetikidis, to discuss floods. </p>
<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/Meeting%20with%20Tassos.jpg" class="problem"height="50%">
<p> Here are some notes that we took: </p>
<ul class="listtraits"> 
<li class="listtraits"> occur when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel </li>
<li class="listtraits"> some floods develop slowly while flash floods can develop slowly with little warning </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Alberta flood, 2013: </li>
<ul>
<li class="listtraits"> 28 emergency operations centres were activated </li>  
<li class="listtraits"> 100,000 people were displaced </li>
<li class="listtraits"> the amount of rain that fell happens roughly once in 50-100 years </li>
<li class="listtraits"> people did not have experience with these types of floods and were, therefore, not prepared </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p> After this meeting, we came up with many solutions such as:</p>
<h3> A Polymer Seal </h3>
<p> During a 1-2 inch flood, water can leak through cracks in doorways and windows which will lead to the destruction of a house.  "80% of flood damage is caused by 2 inches or less water", FEMA.  Existing solutions for this problem include a wall that covers the bottom half of the door to prevent water from seeping in through the cracks.  The issue is that this wall will have to be pre-installed and would be expensive to do this.  Our solution is a tube filled with a water absorbing polymer that will expand when in contact with water.  The substance in the tube is similar to the polymer in diapers. This tube will fit in between the door and the door frame.  When flood water reaches the tube, it will expand and create a tight seal between the door and frame to prevent any water from going into the house.  It can be installed with ease and will be cheap so that everyone will be able to afford it.  </p>
<h3> A Flood Water Breaker </h3>
<p> During a flood, water in your house ends up in a low point, like your basement. Our innovative solution targets during or after a flood when one is wading through the couple of inches of flood water and comes in contact with something metalic (e.g. a fridge or stove).  One may be electrocuted by the electrical currents in the water. Our device is a floater that is inside a tube and when flood water comes in it will raise that floater to trigger a sensor one or 2 inches above the ground. When this sensor is triggered it sends an electrical signal to the fuse box that shuts off all electricity in the house to diminish the risk of electrocution. This tube would be placed on the wall, can be installed after the house is constructed and is inexpensive. </p>
<h3> A Helium Balloon Wi-Fi Network </h3>
<p> We had an idea to use tethered helium balloons in a disaster area to provide a temporary wi-fi area. The balloons would have satellite connected wi-fi routers that would provide the wifi. They would not be so high as to lose considerable range, instead just above the height of the debris and buildings so the signal can reach a further distance. The point of this would be so that people can stay connected on devices even if the power is out, their homes are destroyed, etc. They would be able to communicate with loved ones, friends, and receive updates about the disaster. The balloons could be brought in by rescue aid crews, and tethered to the ground every so often. </p>
<h3> A Floating Flood Sign </h3>
<p> The floating flood sign idea was inspired by a real-world story about a man in Toronto who drove his Ferrari into a low lying area during the storm of July 2013.  He underestimated the depth of the water in the tunnel and he had to abandon his car.  To address this problem, we came up with a sign that would only deploy if the water level rose to a certain height. There would be a foam flotation attached to the sign's post, which would raise, along with the sign during a storm with flooding.</p>
<h3> Meeting Notes - Patricia Martel, Natural Hazards and Risk Specialist and Jude Kelly, Communications and Public Educations Officer </h3> 
<p> On November 4, 2013, the team met with two experts with Emergency Management Ontario (EMO). </p> 
<img src="Pictures%20for%20Website%20Alex%20Mark/Jude%20Kelly%20and%20Patricia%20Martel.jpg" class="problem" height="50%">
<p> They talked to us about different types of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, and what to put in an emergency kit.  Here are some of the notes that we took from the presentation:</p> 
<h3> Earthquakes </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> the rocks in Ontario and Quebec transmit seismic energy </li>
<li class="listtraits"> aftershocks can be stronger </li>
</ul>
<h3> Floods </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> Fast snowmelt causes flooding </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Saturated soil is non-absorbent </li>
<li class="listtraits"> People love living near water, causing them to be in the floodplain, and therefore danger </li>
<li class="listtraits"> During a flood, ice can float and smash buildings and property </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Riverine- when a river overflows </li>
<li class="listtraits">Seiches- a local rise in water level due to wind or earthquakes </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Urban flood- floods that can cause lots of property damage in large cities </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Storm Surge- high wind speeds blow huge waves to nearby land </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Floods cause mold and sewers to back up </li>
<li class="listtraits"> rainfall on a radar dome can cause inaccurate predictions in the amount of rain </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Floods are happening more frequently because of cement </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Most people die from being in their cars in a flood because they don't realize how deep the water is </li>
</ul>
<h3> Rain Storms </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> the Toronto flood was caused by a rainstorm </li>
<li class="listtraits"> people go through a road with water but don't know if there is pavement and people get stuck </li>
</ul>
<h3> Landslides </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> Ottawa area is much more prone to landslides </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Tilting land is a sign of a landslide </li>
</ul>
<h3> Snowstorms </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> It does not necessarily snow during a bizzard, it may just be static snow being blown towards you </li>
<li class="listtraits"> You are mainly safe at home, but when travelling you are most at risk </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Usually people that are stuck in snow storms (in cars) have a higher risk of getting killed </li>
<li class="listtraits"> People are less likely to be prepared for a snowstorm if they are not used to snow </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Being cold and trapped in a car is a very dangerous situation </li>
</ul>
<h3> Freezing Rain </h3>
<ul class="listtraits"> 
<li class="listtraits"> When a lot of the freezing rain gets stuck on tree branches or power lines they can begin to snap </li>
</ul>
<h3> Tornadoes </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> To tell if it is a tornado you have to see if deris on the ground is spinning and there is a funnel cloud </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Size doesn't affect the strength of a tornado </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Ontario has never had an EF 5 tornado </li>
<li class="listtraits"> A lot of the tornados we get in ontario are hard to see because they are covered in rain </li>
<li class="listtraits"> When a tornado is happening there usually big hail, the sky changes colour and there is a big roaring noise, along with thunderstorms </li>
<li class="listtraits"> The lakes can trigger tornados because of the warm frot from the water mixing with the cold air </li>
</ul>
<h3> Wildfires </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> Human caused wildfires are most problematic because they are closer to cities and happen most often </li>
</ul>
<h3> Windstorms </h3>
<ul class="listtraits">
<li class="listtraits"> Some things like downbursts can cause similar damage to tornadoes </li>
<li class="listtraits"> Huge power outages can happen during a windstorm. </li>
</ul>
<p> After we met with Jude Kelly and Patricia Martel and showed them our four possible solutions, we decided to try to use their feedback and narrow our options down to one solution. We decided that the door flood barrier would prevent the easy access of emergency personnel into a building and would ruin the door after being expanded. For the flood road evacuation sign, we found several versions of it that already exist.  For example, there are ones recently installed in Bexar, Texas. We also eliminated the idea of the electrical water breaker because the common circuit breaker already shuts off the electricity automatically. Finally, we did not use the idea of the Wi-Fi balloons because we wanted to be able to make a prototype for the presentations. Therefore, we had to come up with a new solution.</p>
